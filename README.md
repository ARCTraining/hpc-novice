Novice introduction to high performance computing

This lesson is under development.  Please join our [mailing list][mailing-list]
to stay up-to-date with what is happening with the lesson.  

## Current status

Several people have already written individual 
carpentry lessons for hpc center training.  (See a list of them [here][local-lessons].)  
Our goal is to take the main 
ideas from these lessons into a common base that individuals can then fork and customize 
with the pieces that are specific to their system.  

At the moment, the audience and major 
topics of the workshop are set.  See: 
- [the rendered website][website] for the current outline of topics
- [this issue][audience] for the audience and scope

## Next steps

The next stage of development is contributions from the community to refine and fill in 
the outline.  We welcome pull requests that add material.  If you have a suggestion 
re: organization of material, please open an issue for discussion.
