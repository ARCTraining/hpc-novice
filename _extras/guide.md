Because different compute resources have different features, this 
lesson, by necessity, should be thought of as completely modular.  
We have here the basic topics that might be required, in a recommended order, 
but additions and deletions are encouraged, based on the needs of the 
audience and the compute resource that is being used.  It could also be 
expanded or contracted to fill a certain amount of time -- the default 
time period should be about day, but for a complete novice audience 
(has **never** used the command line), it should be more like a day 
and a half, or two days.
