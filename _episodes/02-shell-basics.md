Topics: 

Recommendation: for a novice audience, go through 1,2,3 in 
the [shell-novice lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

Also convey: 
The shell is more than a way to look at files or folders. It's also a way to run programs.

Programs may expect data as input and may produce data as output. The shell lets us 
control which programs to run on which inputs and what to do with the output.

Maybe use a shell program like sleep or grep as an example, or another simple executable.  

Then do part 6 of the shell lesson.  

For a more advanced audience, just do part 6, so that you can use 
the script later in the workshop.
