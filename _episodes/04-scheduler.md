> ## Job scheduling roleplay
> 
> Divide the room in groups, with specific roles
> 
> * Pick one or two people to be the "scheduler"
> * Have one third of the room be "users", given several slips of 
> paper (or post-it notes) and pens
> * Have two thirds of the room be "compute nodes"
> 
> "Users" should fill out their slips of paper with math problems.  
> These math problems represent any kind of computation that you 
> might want to run on the cluster.  How will these computations 
> get to the compute nodes?  The "scheduler" will need to collect 
> the math problems from the "users" and deliver them to the "compute 
> nodes", returning the results when the node is done.
